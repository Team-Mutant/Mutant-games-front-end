From the dev team that brought you *Duck Duck Shoe*.

Mutant Games is an open source video game lobby service! Users can create and join lobbies to connect with their friends and chat about their favorite video games.

## Getting Started:

Here are links to the [deployed applcation](https://mutant-games.herokuapp.com/) and a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/K7ydDNPv/tmnt) containing project planning materials.

To run the project locally:

1. Clone and initiate the [back-end repository](https://github.com/Team-Mutant/Mutant-games-back-end) (following the step-by-step setup guide in the README).

2. Navigate to the directory you want to clone this app into and run the command: 

 ```bash 
 git clone git@github.com:Team-Mutant/Mutant-games-front-end.git
 ```

3. After cloning the front-end project directory, run the command: 

```bash
touch .env
```

4. Add the following line of code to the .env file you just created.

```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001/
```

5. Install all dependencies by running the command: 

```bash
npm i
```

6. Spin up the app by running the command: 

```bash
npm start
```
